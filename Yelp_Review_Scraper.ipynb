      "Review: Should really be 4.5 stars. The only knock is that their wait times are ridiculously long, and their stated wait times on their screens significantly understate the wait times. We came around 730 this past Saturday, during the heat wave and standing around for 40 minutes was miserable.I will say though that the wait was still worth it because these cheesesteak was delicious!! The meat was tender but will just enough chew to give it a good texture, and the cheese was fully incorporated throughout. I got salt and pepper, and fried onions; no peppers this time and that was the right move!If you are in the area, make a trip here but plan to wait twice whatever is stated on their screen. You have been warned.\n",

      "Review: Got the mushroom cheesesteak with provolone sharp, grilled onions, and long hots. Initially I wasn't impressed , but the more I ate the more I liked it. The meat wasn't as flavorful as I'd like, but I was raised on carne asada simmered in a pot. The bread was mediocre and tasted store bought. The provolone sharp bound the meat well and provided some much needed fat, but there wasn't enough bite to the sandwich.In fairness, the consistency of the meat made it really easy to bite into with absolutely zero gristle. The long hots provided a bit of texture but no heat, while the grilled onions and mushrooms rounded out the experience. A more umami back-of-the tongue profile is what I wanted.I called ahead and the girl taking orders was efficient and clear. It's cash-only, with separate lines for ordering and for pick-up. The girl who took my order was working the line, kicking out those whose names were not called over the speaker and displayed prominently on the screen by the windows.I asked the people in line what their faves were and the #1 answer was the classic cheesesteak. At the window I requested long hots and the crew gave me a side quick. Parking is convenient, but don't expect to eat there: get your food and get the hell out! The neighborhood is clean, safe, and a few blocks from Main St.It's better than Chubby's but I can't imagine it's the best the city has to offer. It does make me think I may not dislike cheesesteaks as a meat delivery unit... but I need better bread and more flavor.If you're in Roxborough, this is the place to try.\n",

      "Review: Update - I went golfing at Walnut Lane on Monday, and, of course, walked over to Dalessandro's after playing. To be honest, I began thinking about the cheesesteak on the 12th hole.I had triple onions and double cheese - yes, when they took my order, there was a big smile when I said \"..triple onions\". When can you EVER have too many onions?The cheesesteak was exceptional - I savored every bite (and ate all the onions)!\n",

      "Review: This favorite came highly recommended from several locals from Philly. I made the drive up on a Friday around 2:00pm. Luckily for me, there was no line and plenty of street parking was available.I kept it simple with the classic cheesesteak with onions. The bread was the softest I've ever had for a sandwich.  Since they weren't busy, it took less than 10 minutes to get my sandwich.  I loved the meat to cheese ratio and the onions simply set it off just right!The only is I wished the meat was seasoned a tad more but overall I would def come back especially for the value. My sandwich was $14.Remember: they are CASH ONLY\n",
